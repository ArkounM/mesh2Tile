# Changelog

All notable changes to the mesh2tile project will be documented in this file.

## [2.0.0] - 2025-10-07

### Major Refactor - Adaptive Tiling Pipeline

This release represents a complete rewrite of the mesh-to-3D-tiles pipeline with significant performance and reliability improvements.

### Added
- **Adaptive Octree Tiling**: New intelligent spatial partitioning that creates LOD hierarchy based on geometry density
- **Blender-based GLB Conversion**: Native Blender export replacing problematic obj23dtiles npm dependency
- **Parallel Processing**: Multi-worker support for texture baking (4 workers) and GLB conversion (4 workers)
- **Texture Baking**: Automatic texture baking for each tile with UV unwrapping
- **New Blender Scripts**:
  - `adaptiveTiling.py` - Octree-based spatial tiling with adaptive LOD generation
  - `obj2glb.py` - Native Blender OBJ to GLB conversion with embedded textures
- **New Pipeline Modules**:
  - `blender_obj2glb.py` - Python wrapper for Blender GLB conversion
  - `triggerBlender.py` - Unified Blender script execution interface

### Changed
- **BREAKING**: Main entry point renamed from `main.py` to `mesh2tile.py`
- **BREAKING**: Removed obj23dtiles dependency (replaced with Blender native export)
- **BREAKING**: New directory structure - testAdaptiveTiling promoted to root
- **Improved**: Mesh cleanup now removes non-manifold edges before decimation
- **Improved**: Parallel execution eliminates npm cache conflicts
- **Improved**: Windows Unicode encoding fixes for console output
- **Improved**: Better error handling with per-LOD conversion tracking

### Removed
- obj23dtiles npm-based conversion (unreliable, npm cache conflicts)
- Old LOD generation workflow (lodOBJ.py, generate_LODs.py)
- Old tiling workflow (tileOBJ.py, tileLOD.py)
- Legacy assignTexture2LOD.py module

### Fixed
- **Critical**: 100% failure rate in OBJ to GLB conversion (npm cache issues)
- Non-manifold edges causing holes in decimated meshes
- Unicode encoding errors on Windows console
- Texture path resolution in tiled meshes
- Race conditions in parallel npm cache access

### Performance
- **File Size Reduction**: Test outputs reduced from 560 MB to 40 MB (93% reduction)
- **Texture Optimization**: Alpha-masked textures reduce tile sizes from 17 MB to 1 MB each
- **Processing Speed**: Parallel baking and conversion significantly faster than serial processing

### Migration Guide

#### For Users of Old Pipeline:
1. Update entry point: `python main.py` → `python mesh2tile.py`
2. Old pipeline scripts archived in `_archive/` directory
3. No changes to command-line arguments
4. Node.js/npm still required for tileset.json generation and gzip (3d-tiles-tools)

#### Key Differences:
- **Old**: Sequential LOD generation → tiling → conversion
- **New**: Adaptive octree tiling → parallel baking → parallel conversion
- **Old**: npm-based obj23dtiles for GLB conversion
- **New**: Native Blender GLB export with Draco compression

### Architecture
```
Old Pipeline (v1.x):
Input OBJ → Generate LODs → Tile each LOD → Bake textures → obj23dtiles → 3D Tiles

New Pipeline (v2.0):
Input OBJ → Adaptive Octree Tiling → Parallel Texture Baking → Parallel Blender GLB Export → 3D Tiles
```

### Technical Details
- Blender 4.5+ required
- Python 3.8+ required
- Node.js/npm required for tileset.json generation and gzip (3d-tiles-tools)
- Removed obj23dtiles npm dependency (replaced with Blender native)
- Parallel processing: 4 workers for baking, 4 workers for conversion
- Octree max depth: 3 levels (configurable)
- Triangle threshold: 20,000 per tile (configurable)

### Credits
- Adaptive tiling algorithm based on octree spatial partitioning
- Blender Python API for native GLB export
- Process-based parallelization for improved throughput
